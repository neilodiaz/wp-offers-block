Offers Plugin block scaffolded with Create Block tool.

First plugin I made for Gutenberg and JSX.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/offers-block` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the plugin by typing `/Offer Block` or search on the Block components.
4. On the right, you should see a Settings section to add your API End Point.
